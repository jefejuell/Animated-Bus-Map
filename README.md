# Animated Bus Map
<a href="https://jefejuell.github.io/Animated-Bus-Map/"> Animated Bus Map <a/>

## The Animated Bus Map project was created for an MIT xPro Web Development course. 

### **Description:**  
After clicking on the button in the upper left corner, the map marker will move from one bus stop to the next one on it's travel on Massachusetts Avenue from MIT to Harvard.  I changed the mapbox styling to a satellite image allowing viewers to visualize the bus stop locations in relation to local landmarks.

### **Usage**
To view Animated Bus Map on your local machine, download the animatedMaps.html, mapAnimation.js and styles.css files into a folder and drag the animatedMaps.html into a web browser. Alternatively, you can click on the link above or go to https://jefejuell.github.io/Animated-Bus-Map 

### **Roadmap of future improvements**
Additional features will be to have this bus tracker move all the way along Mass. Ave. from Harvard to the South End neighborhood in Boston.  It would also be helpful to have addresses of bus stops appear at each bus stop.

### **License Information**
The project is created under the MIT license.
